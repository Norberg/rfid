This library prefers if it can find the rfid device at 
/dev/rfid its possible to change PORT in rfid.py to point to
elsewhere but not recommended since it will differ depending on
other device connected, instead write a udev rule that takes
care of it.

Create a new file in /etc/udev/rules.d called local.rulse and put:
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb",ATTRS{serial}=="A7006RNG",KERNEL=="ttyUSB*",SYMLINK+="rfid"

Where ATTRS{interface} is the same as found with:
sudo udevadm info -a -p /sys/class/tty/ttyUSB0 | grep serial

Then replug the device and /dev/rfid should appear.
